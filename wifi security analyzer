Wireless networks (Wi-Fi) are integral to modern connectivity but often present significant security risks. A Wi-Fi Security Analyzer is a tool or framework used to assess the vulnerabilities, configuration issues, and threat vectors associated with wireless networks.
Identify insecure Wi-Fi networks.

Detect unauthorized access points (Rogue APs).

Analyze encryption protocols and configurations.

Detect MAC spoofing and deauthentication attacks.

Monitor network traffic for suspicious activity.

Tool	Description
Aircrack-ng	Suite for auditing wireless networks. Includes tools for packet capture, password cracking, and replay attacks.
Wireshark	Network protocol analyzer for capturing and inspecting packets in real-time.
Kismet	Wireless network detector, sniffer, and intrusion detection system.
Reaver	Used to exploit WPS vulnerabilities.
NetSpot	Visual Wi-Fi analyzer and site survey tool.
Wifite	Automated wireless attack tool targeting WEP/WPA/WPS.


Step 1: Reconnaissance
Scan for available networks (SSID, BSSID, channel).

Identify encryption protocols (WEP, WPA, WPA2, WPA3).

Step 2: Traffic Capture
Use monitor mode to capture packets (e.g., with airodump-ng).

Analyze beacon frames, probe requests, and data packets.

Step 3: Vulnerability Assessment
Check for weak passwords or outdated encryption (e.g., WEP).

Test WPS PIN with Reaver.

Look for open or poorly configured guest networks.

Step 4: Attack Simulation (Ethical Use Only)
Deauthentication attack to test response to spoofing (e.g., aireplay-ng).

Handshake capture for WPA/WPA2 cracking.

Step 5: Reporting
Document SSID vulnerabilities.

Summarize risk levels.

Recommend mitigations (e.g., switch to WPA3, disable WPS, use MAC filtering, etc.).
